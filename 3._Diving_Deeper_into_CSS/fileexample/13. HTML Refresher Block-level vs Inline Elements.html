<p>It's not really a CSS&nbsp;topic, though it's related to it:&nbsp;The difference between <strong>block-level</strong> and <strong>inline elements</strong>.</p><p>You can find a free YouTube video about this topic here:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5z_mxjjwKw" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5z_mxjjwKw</a></p><p><em>Here's the executive summary:</em></p><p><strong>Block-level elements</strong> are rendered as a block and hence take up all the available horizontal space. You can set margin-top and margin-bottom and two block-level elements will render in two different lines.</p><p>Some examples are:&nbsp;<code>&lt;div&gt;</code>&nbsp;, <code>&lt;section&gt;</code>&nbsp;, <code>&lt;article&gt;</code>&nbsp;, <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code>&nbsp; but also <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>&nbsp;, <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code>&nbsp; etc and <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>&nbsp;.</p><p><strong>Inline elements&nbsp;</strong>on the other hand only take up the space they require to fit their content in. Hence two inline-elements will fit into the same line (as long as the combined content doesn't take up the entire space in which case a line break would be added).</p><p>They also use the box-model you learned about but <code>margin-top</code>&nbsp; and <code>margin-bottom</code>&nbsp; have no effect on the element. <code>padding-top</code>&nbsp; and <code>padding-bottom</code>&nbsp; also have a different effect. They don't push the adjacent content away but they will do so with the element border. You can read more about that behavior in the following article:&nbsp;<a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2015/03/understanding-inline-box-model/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://hacks.mozilla.org/2015/03/understanding-inline-box-model/</a></p><p>Additionally, setting a <code>width</code>&nbsp; or <code>height</code>&nbsp; on an inline element also has no effect. The width and height is auto to take as much space as required by the content.</p><p>Logically, this makes sense since you don't want your inline elements to destroy your multi-line text-layout. If you want to do so or need both block-level and inline behavior, you can set <code>display: inline-block</code>&nbsp; to merge behaviors.</p><p>Some example elements are:&nbsp;<code>&lt;a&gt;</code>&nbsp;, <code>&lt;span&gt;</code>&nbsp;, <code>&lt;img&gt;</code>&nbsp;</p>
